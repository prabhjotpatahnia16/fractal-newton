# Newton Fractal (PyTorch Implementation)

## Overview
This project implements a **Newton fractal** using **PyTorch** for vectorised computation and optional GPU acceleration.  
The Newton fractal is generated by applying Newton's method in the complex plane to find roots of a polynomial, then colouring each point according to the root it converges to and the number of iterations required.

## Features
- **PyTorch-based** â€” can run on CPU or GPU (`cuda` if available).
- **High performance** vectorised calculations.
- Customisable polynomial, resolution, iteration limits, and colour mapping.
- Supports exporting the fractal image to PNG.

## Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and PyTorch installed.  
You can install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install torch matplotlib numpy
